# Krypton
Krypton is a self-host organisational tool to help schools, large businesses and groups organise tools and resources.

We're currently at version 1.1a.

## About
Krypton is being built with PHP, MySQL (or MariaDB), Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

It can be used anywhere you can install PHP5 (PHP7 has not been tested yet) and a MySQL database.

We are building Krypton mainly as an educational exercise for us, but if people can get some use out of it, why not.
